# Orlando Mota 👨‍💻

Hello there! I'm Orlando Mota, a passionate Computer Engineering student at SENAI/CIMATEC. I'm on a journey to gain experience in the tech world, always eager to learn and face new challenges. I have a deep interest in physics, mathematics, quantum computing, and competitive programming. I harbor the aspiration that one day I'll be able to contribute my own 'brick' to the monumental 'wall of knowledge' that humanity has been building since ancient times. As one of the greatest minds to ever walk the Earth, Isaac Newton, once said: "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."
