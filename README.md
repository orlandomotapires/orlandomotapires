Hello there! I'm Orlando Mota, a passionate Computer Engineering student at SENAI CIMATEC. I have a deep interest in physics, mathematics and quantum computing.

## 📚 About Me

I am a Computer Engineering student at Universidade Senai CIMATEC. Currently, I am working full-time at the Fraunhofer IPT in the field of high-precision cutting simulation using quantum computing.

In addition, I am pursuing a sandwich degree program at RWTH Aachen University, with a focus on Quantum Information and Computing.

During my undergraduate studies, I have conducted scientific research projects in the areas of High-Performance Computing (HPC), Machine Learning, and Quantum Computing. I am also the co-founder of a student-led initiative called the Programming Club at Universidade Senai CIMATEC.
